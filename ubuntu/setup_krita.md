# Krita, probably my asylum 
since SAI2 is both...
- hard to get now without the random activation code reseller that I happen to find on the internet
- and not available on linux

### Installing Krita

There are various ways that Krita can be installed, and since I'm on the idiot's distro (aka Ubuntu desktop), the options I recommend are:
- app image: officially recommended, free, portable, no hassle.
- Steam (if you have the money)

The ones I ended up not going for:
- Flatpak: probably the best one if you're already using flatpak for something else, I'm not, so nope for me
- apt: actually even lazier than app image, but undoubtedly *the* worst, due to lack of maintenance.
- snap: also pretty lazy, but apparently not well maintained either. 

TLDR appimage, flatpak, or steam

### Configuring Krita

This was the part that amazed me a lot, because...

Guess what, for whatever reason, fking ubuntu supports Wacom tablets, out of the box!

GPT initially recommended to me about configuring through the command line using a built in package (which is astonishing on its own, considering how windows doesn't have Wacom drivers built in, but somehow ubuntu does)

But apparently wayland blocked that path...
Which turned out fine, because guess what, gnome listed wacom tablets as a *separate* category, parallel with sound and graphics!

holy moly.

### Bottom line

Honestly I understand why people are going for SAI2, procreate, Clip Studio Paint, or Photoshop (mayyybe not MS paint)
- SAI2 has its userbase since tons of years ago
- procreate won over all the iPad apps
- CSP has superb official and community support as a paint-specific tool
- and Photoshop...well it's fking photoshop. Using Photoshop just for painting is like using a Swiss army knife just for poking cling film.

And I understand how Krita is not enticing unless you meet *very* specific criteria, such as:
- you're bored enough to endure bad Krita (from what I heard) in its past versions
- you want to buy random paint software on steam (I mean steam store is fine, but really?)
- you're a weird cave potato that somehow decided to work with images on fking Linux (even if its ubuntu!)

but welp, that's what happened to me.
